    <h1>Thrash Song Meanings</h1>

    <h2>Atrophy</h2>
    <p>Atrophy (originally called Heresy) is a thrash metal band that formed in 1986 in Tucson, Arizona. They were part of the second wave of thrash metal that swept through the USA with the likes of Testament, Dark Angel, Vio-lence, Forbidden, Flotsam and Jetsam, etc. In 1987, Atrophy released two cassette demos (“Chemical Dependency” and “Advanced Promo”) which helped eventually get them signed by Roadrunner Records. In 1988, they released their debut album “Socialized Hate”. In 1990, they released their second and (to this date) final record “Violent by Nature” before the band broke up in 1993. In 2015, they reformed and are planning on releasing a new album in 2021.</p>

                <p>“Socialized Hate” came out on November 7th, 1988 on Roadrunner Records. It is Atrophy’s debut album and came out after they released two well-received cassette demos in “Chemical Dependency” (1987) and “Advanced Promo” (1987).</p>
                <p>The album artwork depicts a Jester pulling USA and USSR nuclear warheads out of the ground – likely alluding to the arms race / Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.) during the Cold War given the album’s 1988 release date. The cover illustration was done by Brian Anderson.</p>

                            <p>This song touches on the topic of war. The solider in the song enlisted to help fight for his country’s freedom but his motive shifts as he develops an obsession for killing – becoming a “killing machine”. His country doesn’t care about him even though he sacrifices so much for them. Politicians just use him as a pawn in their game and will simply replace him with a new solider/pawn when he becomes a casualty of their war.</p>

                            <p>I believe this song references the disdain the punk scene had for heavy metal fans in parts of the 1980s (particularly in Los Angeles, CA). The punks would stick to their kind and not want to be friends/associate themselves with someone rocking long hair that might be a fan of heavy metal because they’re from a different scene.</p>
